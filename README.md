# Codifin Test

This is a complete implementation of a technical test.

## Frontend

For the application's frontend, a connection is made to the [Dummy Data](https://codifin-test.vercel.app/api/products). I chose to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the framework, and I utilized [RKT Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) to manage the API calls.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Instructions

From the project's root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
```

## Testing

To see the application in action, open your browser and visit [localhost](http://localhost:3000/).

Enjoy your experience with the system!

> **_NOTE:_** I know the best practice is to create a .env file for the vars secrets and another configurations, but given this is only for test I omitted it.
